[Franz] Stop!

361
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:02,916
Stop him!

[grunts]

363
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,916
I knew you were a liar from the get-go.
Someone stole a crew uniform yesterday.

364
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,791
You wouldn't happen to know
who that someone is?

365
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:43,333
Do you know what we do with stowaways?

366
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:45,041
[intense drumbeat plays]

367
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,458

[passengers chattering]

371
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:25,708
Krester, Mother is still looking for Ada.
No one has seen her for hours.

372
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,041
She wants us to help find her.

373
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:35,583
Where did you get that?

374
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:37,083
Give it to me.

375
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,916
Was it that man who gave it to you?

376
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:45,875
You fool.

377
00:35:47,708 --> 00:35:49,041
Why did you accept it?

378
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:55,041
Because.

379
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:59,291
Because it was nice of him
to give it to me.

380
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,291
And what did he want?

381
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:06,083
Rich people don't give you
anything for free.

382
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:09,708
They always want something in return.

383
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:13,583
You of all people should know that.

384
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:35,500
[low, ominous chord plays]

385
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:50,583
[in Spanish] You look like
you got some rest.

386
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:53,708
[Ramiro] I suppose
it wasn't a dream after all.

387
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:58,500
Why are we still here?

388
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,625
-Do you think they'll send someone?
-Send who?

389
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:04,958
The police.

390
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:10,791
There are hundreds of people
missing from that boat.

391
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:13,500
The last thing
they're interested in is us.

392
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:18,791
That boy.

393
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:20,750
The look in his eyes.

394
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:22,916
It was terrifying.

395
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:26,250
[Tove in Danish] Let go of me.

396
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:27,708
Hey!

397
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:33,250
You rich fuckers think
everything belongs to you.

398
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:36,750
That you can take whatever you want.
Keep your dirty hands off my brother.

399
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:39,375
If you touch him again,
I'll fucking cut your dick off.

400
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,583
[in Spanish] What?

401
00:37:56,916 --> 00:37:58,375
Don't look at me like that.

402
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:00,875
Don't judge me.

403
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,833
Don't you dare judge me.

404
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:07,333
I've never pretended
to be someone I'm not.

405
00:38:08,541 --> 00:38:10,041

409
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:16,750
[in German] I…

410
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:19,708
I found out what you wanted to know.

411
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:28,541
And?

412
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,666
The bunkers are half-loaded.

413
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,333
Two of them are almost empty.

414
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:37,416
So roughly 3,000 tons remaining.

415
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:42,125
Captain, when will we get back on course?

416
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:47,416
Captain.

00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,208
[in English] I don't even know
if you understand what I'm saying.

422
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,541
But if you do, I'm looking for someone.

423
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:32,041
My brother.

424
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,083
He's been missing for four months.

425
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:38,916
I think that he was on the Prometheus.

426
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:45,958
But I know that he's not dead
because I think he sent me this.

427
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:53,458
This looks exactly like the sign
on your neck.

428
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:55,000
Why do you have that?

429
00:40:56,791 --> 00:40:58,625
What happened on the Prometheus?

430
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:00,708
[bell ringing in distance]

431
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:08,416

your questions.

Just, everyone, please assemble
in the dining room.

433
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:12,750
What's happening?

434
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:14,250
They're not telling us.

435
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:17,291
That's what you get when you have
a bloody German running this shit show.

436
00:41:17,916 --> 00:41:20,708
Everyone, please assemble
in the dining room.

The captain would like
to address the situation.

Try to get some sleep.

439
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:26,916

Everyone, please assemble
in the dining room.

00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:47,083
The captain would like…

448
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,833
[in Spanish] Why do you always
have to spoil the mood?

449
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:09,458
That's what concerns you?

450
00:42:10,083 --> 00:42:11,500
That I'm spoiling the mood?

451
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:17,291
-What are you so afraid of?
-I'm afraid they will find out.

452
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:18,708
Find out what?

453
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:23,375
That you're not really a priest
or not really my brother?

454
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:28,208
Everyone probably
already knows the latter.

455
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:33,291
Do you really think anyone out there
believes we're brothers?

00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:36,375
Look at yourself.

457
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:38,541
You are pathetic.

00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:41,458
For Christ's sake,
you're not even Spanish.

You're not my brother.

You're not a priest.

You're Ramiro.

[overlapping agitated chatter]

495
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:20,625
The Kerberos doesn't hold enough coal
to tow the Prometheus to our destination.

The miles behind are
less than the miles ahead,

00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:25,541
which is why we're turning back.

[in French] This is ridiculous!
We can't turn around. Out of the question!

It doesn't make any sense.

1,612, passengers and crew.

503
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:45,583

There is something wrong with that ship.

I think he's wrong.

I don't think he understands
