We need a doctor! We need a doctor!

183
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,083
[man 2 in German] Shut up.

184
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,666
You don't belong up here, creep.

185
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,916
Next time, I'll throw you overboard.

186

Stop!

You were looking for a doctor.

195
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,125
[in Danish] Are you a doctor?

196
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,583
Okay. Come.

How far along is she?

How long have you been with child?

How many months?

206
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,375
How long? Seven months? Six?

207
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,291
[child in Danish] Seven.

208
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,375
[in English] Seven?

209
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,666
[in Danish] Get it out of me!

210
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,000
Get it out now!

211

She thinks the baby is dead.

212

[woman 2] Who is that, Krester?

213
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,791
Why did you bring her?
You idiot. We don't need help.

-[Maura in English] Give me that.
-[woman 1 wails]

215
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,208
[woman 2 in Danish] No. This is wrong.
We don't even know who or what she is.

216
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,291
You must do something.

218

[in English] I can hear its heartbeat.

219
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,041
The pain might come
from the umbilical cord.

220
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,416
It's rare,
but they can get tangled up in it.

221

I have to turn the baby.

222

00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:27,875

[grunting]

226
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,750
[in Danish] No. No. This is wrong.

227
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,875
Do something.
She's going to kill it. It's God's child.

[in French] Maybe if you helped,

instead of lying there, playing dead.

258

Are you telling me this is my fault?

259
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,625
Stop your little act. It's pretentious.

260

Your parents aren't around anymore.
It's fine.

261
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,333
You don't love me. You never did.

262
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,416
This is not a marriage.
It's an arrangement.

263

When I grow up,
I want to be a doctor just like you.

What were you doing down there?

I don't really see
how that's any of your business.

297
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,750
Passengers from first class
aren't allowed down there.

00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,125
There are rules on this ship,
and they shouldn't be challenged.

00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,208
Who made those rules,

300
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,833
and to whose benefit
were they put in place?

301
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,291
[sailor in German] Captain!

302
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,958

[ominous synth music quavers]

304
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,208
For 20 minutes,
we've been receiving the same signal.

305
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,083
I think it's from the lost ship.

306
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:57,958
The Prometheus.

Fifty-nine. Sixty.

311
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,916
[sailor 1] They're just sending
these coordinates.

Over and over. Nothing else.

313
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:44,000
We can't be sure it's the Prometheus.

314
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,000
How far away are we?

315
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:54,166
[sailor 2] We're right here.

At 18 knots.

317
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:04,458
[captain] This is odd.

318
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,125
If they drifted off course
four months ago,

319
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:11,666
the current should have taken them
north of their route, not south.

320
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,750
How did they end up here?

321
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,250

Prepare for turning.
Bring rudder angle to 20 degrees port.

Can't you be a little more careful?

342

-More careful?
-I'm just saying…

343
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:39,041
Don't you think it would be better
to attract less attention?

Do you know what the big difference is
between you and I, dear brother?

I have no fear.

346
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:48,833
And you're consumed by it.

347
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:52,291
Why don't you have a little chat with God?

348
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:55,708
Ask him why he turned you into a sheep

00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:11,125
It's turning.

It's turning.

357
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:16,458
Don't be ridiculous. Why would it turn?

358
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:18,416
The goddamn ship is turning!

00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:23,958
Do you think we're going back?

361
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:26,291
No, this can't be happening.
We can't go back.

362
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:28,583
Dear Lord, please don't let us go back.

363
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:31,541
We can't go back.

[suspenseful music plays]

365
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:36,708
I can't.

[in Danish] Tove?

371
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:53,250
Tove. Tove, wake up.

372
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:55,208
Are you awake?

[gasps]

374
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:06,750
Where are the others?

375
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:09,708
They're all outside, looking for the ship.

376
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:11,416
What ship?

377
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,250
The one that got lost at sea.

378
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:17,750
-What are you talking about?
-They turned our ship around.

379
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:20,291
They got a signal
from the other ship that is lost.

380
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:22,625
[grunts] They turned our ship around?

381
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,375
Are we going back?

382
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,500
No, silly.

383
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,375
I already told you.
They're looking for that lost ship.

384
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:32,125
[ship groaning]

385
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:36,583
Remember the story of the ghost ship
that you told me once?

386
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:40,916
Where the passengers had all sinned
because they killed a whale.

387
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,166
And the spirits of the sea got so angry,

388
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,375
they sent a huge storm
towards the ship and caused black waves.

389
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:51,666
And when they woke up the next morning,
they had all turned into shadows.

390
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:55,208
Maybe that's what happened
to that other ship.

391
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:57,208
Imagine there's only shadows on board.

392
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,916
Stop that nonsense.

393
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:04,875
And don't let Mother and Father hear it.

394
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:06,625
You hear me?

399
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:20,250
May I step inside?

400
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:31,375
Passengers shouldn't be
in this part of the ship either.

401
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:33,541
Is it true that you found the Prometheus?

402
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,250
[door closes]

403
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:50,000
We received a signal.

404
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:54,708
Coordinates. It's not quite clear yet,
but they might come from the Prometheus.

405
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:03,416
You think the passengers,
they're still alive?

406
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:07,333
It's been four months. It's unlikely.

407
00:29:07,416 --> 00:29:09,875
But if they rationed food,
they could've made it.

408
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:14,125
Or at least some of them.

409
00:29:18,416 --> 00:29:20,916
Why do you take such an interest
in the Prometheus?

410
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:24,916
Did you know anyone on board?

411
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:28,750
I… [breathes shakily]

412
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,041
I just noticed we turned the ship.

413
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:36,541
I just want to know
when we're returning to our course.

414
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:46,666
I will address the current situation
in the dining room in an hour.

415
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,333

421
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,958
I saw you talking together at breakfast.

422
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:13,916
I thought I made myself clear.

423
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,875
No talking.

424
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,666
Yes, madam.

431
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:57,625
Six hours ago, we received a message.

Coordinates. Southwest of our course.

433
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:04,416
We believe this message
comes from the Prometheus,

434
00:32:04,916 --> 00:32:07,250
the ship that went missing
a couple of months ago.

435
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:08,208
Believe?

[anxious murmuring]

437
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:12,666
You're not sure
the signal comes from lost ship?

438
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,125
[Eyk] We're not.

439
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,958
But the communication
technology we're using

440
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:18,833
on the ships of this company is rare.

441
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,333
It can reach further distances
than that on other ships.

442
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:25,208
The coordinates were
seven hours away from us.

443
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:28,666
And there's no other ship
from our company traveling this route.

444
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,875
-What else did the message say?
-Just that.

445
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,083
The location.

446
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:35,875
[Mrs. Wilson] And they didn't
identify themselves as the Prometheus?

447
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:39,125
Nor did they say
they were in need of any help?

448
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:44,541

because of message from unknown sender,

I am very sorry, sir.

Is it true?

492
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:37,083
That you studied medicine?

493
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:41,000
I guess Mrs. Wilson was right.

But what's down there is still a mystery.

A hidden world in the shadows.

Captain, with all due respect,

513
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:46,083
we should get back on course.

514
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:49,875
As soon as we have radio contact,
we inform the company about the position.

515
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:51,708
We'll lower a lifeboat.

516
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:56,833
But that's insane.
We should contact the company first.

517

Captain, the first mate is right.

518
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:10,166
You'll be in charge of the bridge
during my absence.

519
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:12,375
This is against regulations.

00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:14,708
You're in command of the ship.
You can't just…

521

Try to reach the company again.

525

that we've found the Prometheus.

00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,416
Shouldn't we take the priest with us?

533
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:16,125
I'm just saying. We have no idea
what awaits us over there, and--

534
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:17,541
[in Spanish] What's he saying?

535
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,000
I think they want you to go with them.

00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:22,083
