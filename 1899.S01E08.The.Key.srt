When you smell a certain smell,

180
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:29,416
you might remember a lot of memories
that are tied to that smell.

181
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,375
So maybe that's what this is, it's…

182
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,416

We already lost the others!

[Henry in English] Even if we delete

to the same triggers.

00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:49,166

what happened in that room.

-No! Please, no! [Elliot sobbing]

240
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,250
You'll forget this ever happened.

You saw the truth, didn't you?

246
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:33,375
You're trapped in this simulation
so your mother can keep you alive.

247
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,083
You're lying. That's not my memories.

248
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,875
You planted that in my brain.

249
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,541
When your mother was your age…

250
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,041
she found a paper
on Plato's cave allegory in my study.

251
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:53,041
She was clearly too young to understand
the abstract concept Plato was suggesting.

252
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:57,458
Nevertheless, she read it over and over.

253
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,958
It was this one thought

254
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,625
that turned her world upside down.

255
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:09,416
<i>The idea that our knowledge has limits</i>

256
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:14,166
<i>and that we can never know</i>
<i>if things truly are how they appear.</i>

257
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,791
<i>We're in a slumber,</i>
<i>unaware of the true nature of things.</i>

258
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,250
<i>One evening she came to me and said,</i>

259
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,208
<i>"If it's true what Plato argues,</i>

260
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,541
<i>then how do we know if anything is real?"</i>

261
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,625
<i>"How do we know that the actual reality</i>

262
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,625
<i>isn't outside the life we're living?"</i>

263
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,958
<i>It was a mighty big thought</i>
<i>for a girl her age.</i>

264
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,583
<i>I looked at her and asked her,</i>

265
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,083
<i>"Isn't that what God is?"</i>

266
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:46,375
<i>"The creator of our reality?"</i>

267
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,166
<i>She thought about it for a moment.</i>

268
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,083
<i>And then she answered,</i>

269
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:55,291
<i>"But then it's the world</i>
<i>God is living in that's real</i>

270
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:59,625
<i>and we are just his doll's house."</i>

271
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,500
<i>"And then again, who created God?"</i>

272
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,916
<i>"Doesn't it go on endlessly?"</i>

273
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:10,000
In a way, this here is a doll's house.

274
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,666
And it was built for you.

275
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,208
You're lying.

276
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,166
That's what your father
wants you to believe.

277

But he has been lying to you.

279

He's changing the shape of things
to cover his tracks.
