[mysterious clattering]

191
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,083
[in English] This morning
in the infirmary,

192
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,625
why did you want me there?

193
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,750
I wanted a second opinion.

194
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,208
And contrary to what Dr. Murray said,

195
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:26,083
I believe you don't let emotions
cloud your judgment.

196
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,916
Thank you.

197
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,250
It was…

198
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,416
kind of you to take the boy in.

199
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,333
He lost everything.

200
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,708
Do you have children?

201
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,333
A couple of years ago,
I had a miscarriage.

202
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:59,583
There were complications,
and I can't have children anymore.

203
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:06,625
I'm sorry.

204
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,833
Why are you so afraid to go back home?

205
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,791
Because I lost everything.

206
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,875
[woman in Cantonese] <i>She knows we lied.</i>

207
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,750
She knows that we are not
who we say we are.

208
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,791
Are you happy now?

209
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,166
Is this how you imagined it?

210
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,625
Your freedom?

211
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,333
I tried to protect you.

212
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,875
-I wanted a better life for you.
-A better life?

213
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,000
All you have ever done is put me in a box.

214
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:08,958
Every time those men
came on board, I had to hide.

215
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:12,000
You put me in a prison.

216
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,708
You can call it whatever you want.

217
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:23,125
But at least
you didn't have to sell yourself.

218
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,041
Is that such a big deal?

219
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,791
I've seen you do that often enough.

220
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,208
I know how it is done.

221
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,458
There is no turning back after this.

222
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,833
It's the kind of dirt that never rubs off.

223
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:45,333
You'll become what I have become, a whore.

224

Ling Yi.

235
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,500
You killed her.

236
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:42,041
[younger Ling Yi] I didn't mean to.

237
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,958
[mother] How much
did you put in her drink?

238
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,708
I just wanted to make her sleep.

239
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,625
It's too late now.

241
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:02,750
Come give me a hand.

242
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,708
We have to get rid of her.

244
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,375

Hurry!

246
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,458
Stop! Stop it!

247
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,083
I'm in here.

[Olek in Polish] What happened?

258
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:14,750
It's okay now.

259
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,500
Easy.

260
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:26,791
Are you cold?

[Ling Yi shivering]

262

[in Polish] I know a better hiding place.

269

Come.

270
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:32,666
[man in Norwegian] Ada is still missing,
and why are we not moving?

271
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:36,041
Maybe they are thinking
about turning back to America.

272
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:39,583
Well, we paid for this.
They better bring us to our destination.

273
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:42,666
We can't go back home. What do they think?

274
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,958
That we have money left
to pay for a second fare?

275
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:47,875
[woman] It's all because of
that other ship out there.

276
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,208
It's cursed.

277
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:51,833
And that boy they found
brought the curse with him.

278
00:23:56,958 --> 00:24:00,208
Or why else would he,
of all passengers, still be alive?

[in German] A doctor examined her.

291

who we are on the inside.

310
00:27:52,541 --> 00:27:55,291
I was forced to hide
who I am my whole life.

311
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,958
I didn't choose my mask.

312

[in Cantonese] Mei Mei?

370
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:54,250
Are you all right?

371
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:01,791
Are you human or a ghost?

372
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:06,000
You must leave now.

373
00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:10,541
My ship isn't leaving until later tonight.

374
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:12,916
I said goodbye
to the girls at the brothel.

375
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,791
Oh, and I wanted to show you something.

376
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:29,875
Look how pretty it is.

377
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:33,791
They told me I'll get more later.

378
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,750
[chuckles]

379
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:41,625
And while I'm waiting
in England for the ship to America,

380
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:46,416
they will give me dance lessons
and teach me Japanese.

[eerie, unsettling string music plays]

382
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:55,000
Aren't you happy for me? I finally have
a chance to get out of here.

383
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:57,500
Why is this happening?
Why is this happening again?

384
00:35:57,583 --> 00:35:58,875
What are you talking about?

385
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:02,625
Mei Mei?

[labored breathing, pained grunts]

388
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:09,000
[Ling Yi] Did you drink that?

389
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:15,458
You offered it to me a minute ago.

390
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:16,416
No.

391
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:19,208
This can't be happening again.

392
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:23,541
It was an accident.

393
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:27,833
I've seen my mother give it
to the men that come here.

394
00:36:27,916 --> 00:36:30,333
They've always woken up again.

395
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:32,791
I just wanted you to sleep.

396
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:34,875
So when you woke up,

397
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:38,333
I would have taken your place
and been on my way to England.

398

[Ling Yi breathing raggedly]

399
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,208

[in Polish] What happened?

403
00:36:57,791 --> 00:36:58,791
Come on.

404
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:01,416
Calm down.

405
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,458
[in Cantonese] I've done

406
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,250
something horrible.

407
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:14,625
This kimono

408
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:17,041
doesn't belong to me.

409
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:19,458
This is not me.

410
00:37:21,833 --> 00:37:23,750
It's all a lie.

411
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,666
We are not supposed to have dreams.

[in Danish] Where have you been?

415
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:51,458
Krester.

416
00:38:51,541 --> 00:38:54,291
Krester, stop! Stop!

417
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,250
Stop. Stop.

418
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:58,583
We have to open the window…

[plaintive music plays]

420
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:03,458
…or her soul can't leave.

[Eyk in English]
They put this here as well.

431
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,166
It's supposed to measure
the steam pressure

432
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:35,083
and send signals up to the bridge.

433
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:38,250
But on the Kerberos, it never worked.

434
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:46,166
You think they lied?
They put it here for something else?

435
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:54,916
Whatever they've done to the ship,
it doesn't explain where everyone went.

436
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:57,750
How hot do these get?

437
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,708
[Eyk] Up to 900 degrees Celsius.

438
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:05,250
A cremator generates
that kind of temperature.

[high-pitched, mysterious tone plays]

440
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:28,208
You think they burned the bodies?

441
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:31,208
You have to look out for tiny fractures
of bones and teeth.

No.

[in Cantonese] I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.

You were right.

We're not supposed to have dreams.

You haven't said a word

You're the first mate.

00:49:53,041 --> 00:49:55,041
You must take command of the ship.

507

You said it yourself.
There's something wrong with that ship.

508

Something killed everyone over there,
and now the same thing is happening here.

509
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:07,000
Why did the company want us
to sink the ship?

510
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:11,666
Maybe they didn't want
whatever is on that ship to get off.

511
00:50:16,875 --> 00:50:18,416
You heard the captain.

512
