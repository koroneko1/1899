00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,208
And then she started to forget our names.

184
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,708
And, eventually, us.

185
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,750
My father, he resented us for it.

186
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,125
He wanted her to get better.

187
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,500
So, he built this.

188
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,208
He wanted to learn
how the human brain worked.

189
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,708
How to repair it if damaged.

190
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,125

Where are you going?

200
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,625
[in German] It's pointless.
We're not going to reach anyone.

[in Danish] I never wanted to be a priest.

205
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,250
I was a farmer.

206
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:38,208
Like my father before me,
and his father before him.

207
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:43,750
And we didn't have a lot of money,
but we were happy.

208
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,958
But then something happened.

209
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:55,666
After that, Iben, my wife,

210
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,708
she started to hear God's voice.

211
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,625
He told her that…

212
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,875
He had other plans for us.

213
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:08,666
Bigger plans.

214
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,541
It gave her hope
when everything seemed hopeless, and I…

215
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,875
And I wanted so badly
to feel the same hope.

216
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,166
But most of all…

217
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,750
I just wanted her to be happy.

[solemn, melancholy music playing]

219
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,750
But I'm a liar.

220

I've never heard His voice.

221
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,041
And if I'm honest…

222
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,916
I don't believe He exists.

[Iben in Danish] They say
we should write our own story.

234
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,458
But that's not true.
It has already been written.

235
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,208
God writes our story.

236
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,833
There's nothing you can do
but to accept His choices.
